Visibility / Discoverability
Basic functions of a system should be easy for user to understand  

Affordances
Real affordance what the object can do

Perceived affordances: what we think the object can do

False affordance: a perceived affordance that doesn't line up with a real affordance.

Hidden affordance a real affordance that isn't matched up with a clear perceived affordance 

Negatice affordance:
Constraints
What cannot be done with object

Physical Constraints
-- Cant move past

Semantic Constraints
-- user knowledege 

Logical Constraints

Cultural Constraints

Mapping 
Relationship between two things

Correspondence 

Model 
Mental Model
What the user believes about the system at hand
 -- based on belief not facts

Conceptual model
Designers intent of the model of the system

Often a big gap between designers 

Activity Cycle 
Norman's action cycle 

									  		Goals 
				Execution 													Evaluation
	What we do to the world 		Comparing what with what we wanted to happen.


						Goals 
Intention to act								
Sequence of actions
Execution of the action sequence 



Gulf of Execution
difference between user's intentions and allowable actions
how well does a system allow a user to perfore their intended actions
Usually caused by a lack of visibility (percevived affordance and constraints)

Gulf of evaluation 
amount of effort required to interpreet state of the system and how well the user's intention has been met
How easy is it to get information about the system and interpret that information and match that interpretation
Usually casued by lack of good feedback. :wq
